Based on PIC16F88

Has onboard regulator and rectifier, can be fed with AC or DC or DCC

Board is generic, provides a breakout for all the PIC pins, also an LED and resonator

Has a programming header and also a servo control header block

so as well as implementing a railcom transmitter it could be used as a DCC servo controller, lights controller
or a generic PIC controller board

And all for $4 US delivered. bargain.  its less faff than plugging all those wires into a breadboard.

And it does not have a single via. wow.  the autoroute did most of the job.

The board will fit into a 1551 Hammond case.

To detect the uni-polar railcom cutout pulse, RB0/1 are used to monitor the XY legs via high value resistors.
their ESP-diodes will provide a clamp to Vcc/Gnd.

Jaycar sell the 88 chip for under five bucks
